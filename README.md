# Monster Builder

This project is a single page ReactJS app that allows the user to create their own 'Monsters', and have them fight each other.

A live site is hosted on Firebase and can be found here https://monster-builder-app.web.app/

## Usage

There is a pre-existing database of Monsters that is displayed on the home page. Adding to the database can be done with the 'Create Monster' tab, additional changes can be made after saving with the 'Edit Monsters' tab.
To have the monsters fight, use the 'fight' tab, select a monster for each slot and press the start button.
